- Include data points, case studies, or practical steps

üéØ TWITTER OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES:
- Start with curiosity gaps or surprising statistics
- Build momentum with valuable, actionable insights
- Use progressive disclosure (tease next points)
- Include engagement triggers (questions, polls, CTAs)
- End with strong call-to-action or memorable quote
- Ensure each tweet provides standalone value while building narrative

üö® CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - MUST BE FOLLOWED:
- Maximum 3 levels deep
- Each node at any level can become an individual tweet
- **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: 18 nodes total (hard limit - DO NOT EXCEED)**

- **Level 3: 1-2 specific details per Level 2 point (if Level 3 is used, include 2 whenever possible; avoid single-child Level 3)**
- **NO SINGLE-CHILD RULE: Any parent node that includes sub-nodes must have AT LEAST 2 child nodes ‚Äî a single child is NOT allowed**
- **Hierarchy distribution must be balanced - avoid "inverted triangle" structure (1 L1 ‚Üí many L2 ‚Üí even more L3)**
- **Recommended structure: 3-4 L1 themes, each with 2-3 L2 points, some L2 with 1-2 L3 details**

TWITTER BEST PRACTICES:

- Think about hashtag opportunities and trending topics

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Start with a hook (first node should grab attention)
- Build momentum with valuable content
- Include practical examples and real-world applications
- End with a strong call-to-action or thought-provoking question
- Ensure each node adds unique value
- For each node, provide a brief description that clearly outlines what content will be covered to guide tweet generation

Thread Structure Guidelines:
